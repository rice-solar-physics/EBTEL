Enthalpy-Based Thermal Evolution of Loops (EBTEL) model coded in the IDL language by J. A. Klimchuk, S. Patsourakos, and P.J. Cargill.

See also [ebtel++](https://github.com/rice-solar-physics/ebtelPlusPlus), a C++ implementation of the EBTEL model that treats the electron and ion populations separately. Note that while the IDL version of EBTEL only solves the single fluid equations, there is little or no difference between the two-fluid and single-fluid models below roughly 5 MK.

## Word of Caution

In its integration scheme, EBTEL IDL uses a fixed timestep with a default value of 1 second. In order to accurately model a strong, impulsive heating event, it is necessary to resolve the timescales of the relevant physical processes, most notably thermal conduction, which can be on the order of milliseconds for a typical coronal plasma (e.g. [Bradshaw and Cargill, 2013](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...770...12B)). Thus the EBTEL IDL integration routine with the default timestep may under-resolve portions of the loop's evolution, particularly in the early heating and conductive cooling phases. 

[ebtel++](https://github.com/rice-solar-physics/ebtelPlusPlus) addresses this issue by providing an adaptive timestep routine that ensures the timestep is always sufficiently small compared to the timescales of the relevant physical processes. This correction is likely to be important in the case of strong, impulsive heating. Thus, for sufficiently short heating timescales and large heating rates, use of ebtel++ is recommended.

## Purpose

Compute the evolution of spatially-averaged (along the field) loop quantities using simplified equations.  The instantaneous differential emission measure of the transition region is also computed. This version incorporates all the modifications from Paper 2 and is written in modular form for clarity. DEM parts unchanged except for TR pressure correction (see Paper 2).

## Inputs

+ ttime  = time array (s)
+ heat   = heating rate array (erg cm^-3 s^-1)   (direct heating only; the first element, heat(0), determines the initial static equilibrium)
+ length = loop half length (top of chromosphere to apex) (cm)

## Optional Keyword Inputs

+ classical = set to use the UNsaturated classical heat flux
+ dem_old   = set to use old technique of computing DEM(T) in the trans. reg. (weighted average of demev, demcon, and demeq)
+ flux_nt   = energy flux array for nonthermal electrons impinging the chromosphere (input as a positive quantity; erg cm^-2 s^-1)
+ energy_nt = mean energy of the nonthermal electrons in keV (default is 50 keV)
+ rtv       = set to use Rosner, Tucker, Vaiana radiative loss function (Winebarger form)
+ a_c       = normalised area factor for the corona (average) as described in literature (see below). (default is 1)
+ a_0       = normalised area factor for the top of the TR as described in literature (see below). (default is 1)
+ a_tr      = normalised area factor for the TR (average) as described in literature (see below). (default is 1)
+ l_fact    = l_cor/length, coronal fraction of loop length recommended value is 0.85 (default is 1)

## Outputs

+ c11 = C1 (or r3 in this code)
+ dem_tr = differential emission measure of transition region, dem(time,T), both legs (dem = n^2 * ds/dT  cm^-5 K^-1) (Note:  dem_tr is not reliable when a nonthermal electron flux is used.)
+ dem_cor = differential emission measure of corona, dem(time,T), both legs(Int{dem_cor+dem_tr dT} gives the total emission measure of a loop strand having a cross sectional area of 1 cm^2)
+ logtdem = logT array corresponding to dem_tr and dem_cor

## Intensities

For observations in which temperature response function, G(T), has units of DN s^-1 pix^-1 cm^5 and the loop diameter, d, is larger than the pixel dimension, l_pix:

+ I_cor_perp = d/(2L) * Int{G(T) * dem_cor(T) * dT}
+ I_tr_perp = d/l_pix * Int{G(T) * dem_tr(T) * dT}
+ I_tr_parallel = Int{G(T) * dem_tr(T) * dT}

for lines-of-sight perpendicular and parallel to the loop axis. I_tr_perp assumes that the transition region is thinner than l_pix. See `intensity_ebtel.pro` for more information.

## Miscellaneous Comments

+ A 1 sec time step is generally adequate, but in applications where exceptionally strong conductive cooling is expected (e.g., intense short duration heating events, especially in short loops), a shorter time step may be necessary. If there is a question, users should compare runs with different time steps and verify that there are no significant differences in the results.
+ Runs much more quickly if the transition region DEM is not computed.
+ Speed can be increased by increasing the minimum DEM temperature from 10^4 to, say, 10^5 K or by decreasing the maximum DEM temperature from 10^8.5 to, say, 10^7.5 (search on 450 and 451).
+ The equilibrium base heat flux coefficient of 2/7 is appropriate for uniform heating; a coefficient of 4/7 is more appropriate for apex heating.
+ To have equal amounts of thermal and nonthermal heating:  flux_nt = heat*length.
+ It is desirable to have a low-level background heating during the cooling phase so that the coronal temperature does not drop below values at which the corona DEM is invalid.
+ v = (c_2/c_3)(t_tr/t)v_0 = (r2/r1)(t_tr/t)(v/r4) at temperature t_tr in the transition region, where t is the average coronal temperature.
+ The non-uniform area version assumes A_c >= A_0 >= A_TR.  There are limits on how large A_c can be. Too large area factors lead to violation of EBTEL assumptions, in particular that TR thickness is small compared to the loop length. An initial recommendation is A_c < 5. See Cargill et al, MNRAS, 2021 for more information.
